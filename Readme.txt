Hi!
Continuing with the developement of simple games, I create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with TKinter. For this project, I had already worked on
all the basics of programing and I did all this on my own. Despite of the simplicity of this game, It made me feel very proud because it was one
of the first projects I made all by myself and I got the final result after multiple tries.
